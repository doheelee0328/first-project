#How I created it:

The project was created using conmbination of HTML, CSS and javascript. 

I used HTML created a basic layout with a header section containing the page title and a navigation menu, a main content section with buttons, 
images and information about my hobbies, and accordion dropdowns, and a footer section where you can access to the contact page. 

I used CSS to add colors, fonts, margins, padding, and other design elements such as flexbox to the HTML content. 
 
I used JavaScript to implement the window prompt() method to display a dialog box with an optional message asking the user to input some texts about
their favourite hobbies. Furhtermore, i added accordion dropdowns, and used the onclick event to toggle the visibility of the content when a hobby 
is clicked.
